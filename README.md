# 16-bit-floating-point-arithmetic
16-bit fixed-point arithmetic, we can use a binary point at bit 15, which gives us a range of -32768 to 32767 and a precision of 1/32768 (approximately 0.00003). To perform arithmetic operations on fixed-point numbers, we can use integer arithmetic and shift the binary point appropriately
